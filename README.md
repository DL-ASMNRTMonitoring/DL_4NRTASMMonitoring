# Description
•	Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is monitored in near real-time using the U-Net model applied to Sentinel-1 imagery.

•	Integrating temporal information derived from CUSUM algorithm, textural, and terrain data significantly improves the performance of the U-Net model.

•	This novel approach has the potential for monitoring ASM globally.
